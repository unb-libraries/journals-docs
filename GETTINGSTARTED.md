# Getting Started

Welcome to the Text Centre! There'll be lots for you to do in the coming weeks and months with the ETC. However, we've all got to start somewhere! Here!

# A Little Context

The Electronic Text Centre does all kinds of work with digital initiatives and is housed in the Harriet Irving Library. Visit [the website](http://etc.lib.unb.ca/) to get a feel for the projects we've been working on or have wrapped up.

You've been chosen (or assigned) to work with Journals production. Primarily, our purpose is to take print versions of academic journals and digitize them for publication in [Open Journals Systems](http://journals.hil.unb.ca/) (OJS). To explain things briefly, this is typically done by taking files received from a publisher, usually in PDF format, scraping the text from it to a format we can work with, and marking that article up with XML. In the case of older, print-only content, we scan the issues, run Optical Character Recognition software (OCR), and work out from there.

We have two types of markup to work on at the ETC. Depending on need, you'll be tasked with either Detailed or Light markup. [Detailed Markup](http://systems.lib.unb.ca/wiki/journals:detailedmarkupguide) requires a highly granular and descriptive markup of the content by hand, using the Oxygen XML editor, for eventual conversion to HTML display within OJS. [Light Markup](http://systems.lib.unb.ca/wiki/journals:tournesolguide) usually requires the use of our markup platform Tournesol, which uses a basic interface for data entry (it is also, likely, what you'll be assigned to do).

> Please Note: Detailed Markup procedures are currently under review. 

This all might seem a little daunting, but don't worry. We've got [documentation](http://systems.lib.unb.ca/wiki/journals) for everything you'll be required to do.

# Getting Your Feet Wet

First things first, it's a really good idea to get acclimatized to HTML, CSS, and XML through various online resources. There are a few places to teach yourself basic familiarity with these languages (please note: you are not expected to be fluent with these languages, these guides are only to help you understand a little context for the work you'll be doing).

**W3 Schools**

- [HTML Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
- [HTML 5 Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/html5/default.asp)
- [CSS Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
- [XML Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp)
- [DTD Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/dtd/default.asp)

**Codeacademy** 

- [HTML Fundamentals](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/html-one-o-one) 
- [Web Fundamentals](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)

Though it's unlikely that you'll be working with these languages on a day-to-day basis at the ETC, contextually they're quite handy for understanding the fundamentals behind all of the work we do. Keep these resources in mind!

# Setup

Hopefully, you've got a machine and dedicated workspace for the time you'll be with us at the text centre. There's some essential setup required to get your work going at the ETC. Your machine should have the following installed and ready for you to use:

- Oxygen XML Editor
- Firefox (or Chrome)
- A connection to the journals production server (if this isn't set up or doesn't appear to be working, contact James Kerr or Jake Sanford)
- Tournesol
- Adobe Acrobat Pro

Optionally, you may also be required to have (depending on if you are doing any Detailed Markup):

- Gemini
- Photoshop
- Terminal Access (you'll have to talk to Jake Sanford about getting this set up)

Additionally, if you are working with journals, it is required that you sign up for an account for the web-based project management software we use, [Trello](http://trello.com/). You can login with a google account or your own email. Once you have registered with the site, please let [James Kerr](mailto:jkerr@unb.ca) know so that you can be invited to our workflow. Trello is a system for tracking our existing projects and assigning students to specific tasks. Ideally, after you've been trained and are ready to work, you'll be able to login to Trello and pick out an item to work on. You will also receive email notifications when you have been assigned a project. 

# Expectations

You're expected to complete your hours as required by your contract. We are generally quite flexible with schedules, but it is ideal for you to work your hours during our work day (9am - 5pm). Please inform James Kerr of your schedule and write it on the white board in the student workroom.

# PayPal Plugin Configuration for OJS

 Copy... [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com)

## Step 1: OJS

1. Go to **Journal Manager**.
2. **Payment**.
3. Click on **Fee Payment Methods** from the sub-menu.
4. Enable PayPal. 
5. For the IPN URL, you'll notice that right below the field it gives you two URLs. Use the one it says for live sites (this one: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr).  
6. Put your PayPal username in the field below.

## Step 2: PayPal

1. Login to Paypal. 
2. Click on the link that says "Profile". 
3. On the left sidebar, click "My Selling Tools".
4. Under the header "Getting Paid and Managing My Risk" you'll see a line that says **Instant payment notifications**.
5. On the right, on that line, click Update. 
6. Enable IPN. 
7. Paste in the same URL you used in OJS. 

## Step 3: **OJS**

1. Go back to **Options** in the sub-menu and populate prices for everything there you wish to have a price for. 
2. Test at home, ideally, so you're not part of an institutional subscription. 

That ought to get you most of the way there. There are a few small details I still have to sort out.

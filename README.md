This repository is for the storage and dissemination of documentation for Journals production at the University of New Brunswick Electronic Text Centre. The majority of this content was written or updating in the late fall of 2013 in the lead up to streamlining journals production. 

Content is also available at the [Systems Wiki](http://systems.lib.unb.ca/wiki/journals), but only for those on UNB's campus. Some docs may be found there that are not found here. 

For anything else you may need – particularly OJS-related documentation – please consult PKP documentation. Check for information in the following places:
